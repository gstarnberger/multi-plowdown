multi-plowdown.py
-----------------

multi-plowdown.py is a plowdown (http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/) launcher
for hosts where multiple IP interfaces are available for download. When starting
a download one thread per interface is launched and download URLs are
distributed to those threads. This allows you to considerably decrease the
waiting time, e.g., if you have 6 interfaces and you want to download 12 files
from a filehoster, you effectively only have to wait once in the delay loop of
the filehoster.

usage: multi-plowdown.py [-h] regexp urls [urls ...]

regexp: Regexp specifying the used network interfaces. E.g., if you are on a
Linux virtual server and want to use all available venet0:0, venet0:1, venet0:2,
etc. interfaces, you would use '^venet0:.*' as regexp.

urls: List of URLs to download. If you want to store the URLs in a file instead
of giving them on the command line use xargs(1) for this.

multi-plowdown.py currently requires the 'argparse' module from a Python 2.7
installation. However, if you use an older Python version you can just copy
argparse.py from a newer Python installation. In addition, the get_interfaces()
method used to retrieve the available interfaces currently only works on Linux.
If you want support for other systems such as *BSD I'm happily accepting
patches.
